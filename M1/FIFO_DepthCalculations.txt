# Specification B

FIFO Operating Conditions:

Transmitter clk1 frequency = 80 MHz
Receiver clk2 frequency = 50 MHz
 
With duty-cycle of 50%. 
Max reads Burst size = 120

Num. of idle cycle between successive writes = 0
Num. of idle cycles between successive reads = 0

There are no idle cycles in both reading and writing which means that, all the items
in the burst will be written and read in consecutive clock cycles
 
Time required to write one data item = 1 x (1/80MHz) = 12.5ns
Time required to write all the data in the burst = 120 x 12.5ns = 1500ns

Time required to read one data item = 1 x (1/50MHz) = 20ns
So, for every 20 ns, the Receiver is going to read one data item in the burst. In a period of 1500ns, 120 data items can be written

The no. of data items can be read in a period of 1500 ns = 1500/20 = 75
The remaining no. of bytes to be stored in the FIFO = 120 - 75 = 45

So, the FIFO which has to be in this scenario must be capable of storing 45 data items

So, the minimum depth of the FIFO should be 45
